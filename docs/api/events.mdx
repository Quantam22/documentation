An event represents a change in user state. Events can be uniquely referenced by Radar `_id`.

###### Object fields

- **`_id`** (string): The unique ID for the event, provided by Radar. An alphanumeric string.
- **`createdAt`** (datetime): The datetime when the event was created.
- **`live`** (boolean): `true` if the event was generated for a user and geofence created with your `live` API key, `false` if the event was generated for a user and geofence created with your `test` API key.
- **`type`** (string): The type of event. By default, events are generated when a user enters a geofence (type `user.entered_geofence`) or exits a geofence (type `user.exited_geofence`). [Places](/places), [Regions](/regions), and [Insights](/insights) also generate events.
- **`user`** (dictionary): The user for which the event was generated.
- **`geofence`** (dictionary): For `user.entered_geofence` and `user.exited_geofence` events, the geofence for which the event was generated, including `description`, `tag`, and `externalId`.
- **`place`** (dictionary): For `user.entered_place` and `user.exited_place` events, the place for which the event was generated, including `name`, `categories`, `chain`, and `facebookId`.
- **`alternatePlaces`** (array): For `user.entered_place` events, alternate place candidates.
- **`verifiedPlace`** (dictionary): For verified `user.entered_place` events, the verified place.
- **`location`** (point): The location of the user at the time of the event, a `Point` in [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) format.
- **`locationAccuracy`** (number): The accuracy of the user's location at the time of the event in meters.
- **`confidence`** (number): The confidence level of the event, one of `3` (high), `2` (medium), or `1` (low).
- **`duration`** (number): On exit events, the duration between entry and exit events, in minutes.

## Create event

To create an event, call the [track](#track) endpoint to trigger an event. For example, specify a `latitude` and `longitude` to enter a geofence that you have created.

On iOS and Android, use the [SDK](/sdk) to track users.
